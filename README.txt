This set of m-files demonstrates how the M2DP algorithm works in principle. M2DP takes one point cloud as input, and outputs a 192 by 1 vector as the point cloud descriptor. 

To run the demo, simply start Matlab and run demo.m. If it is the first time you use this code, please run mex CountVote2D.c in Matlab.
